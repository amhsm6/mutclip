# Mutual Clipboard

This service facilitates rapid, yet highly unsecure data transfer. Upon accessing the homepage, a new clipboard is created where users can input, paste, or upload text and files. When another client connects to the same clipboard via the shared URL, all content is automatically synchronized across connected users.
